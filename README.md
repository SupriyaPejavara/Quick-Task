<h2> Technology Choices </h2>

### Flutter
- **Framework for building mobile apps**: Flutter is an open-source UI framework developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Dart Programming Language**: Flutter uses Dart, a modern programming language, for building applications. It offers fast development and performance.
- **Widget-based UI**: Everything in Flutter is a widget, which provides a highly customizable and responsive UI.
- **Cross-platform development**: With a single codebase, you can build apps for iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Fast Development**: Flutter’s "hot reload" feature allows for quick iteration, making it easier for developers to see changes instantly.

### Back4App
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**: Back4App is a cloud-based platform that offers a ready-to-use backend for mobile and web apps, allowing developers to focus on building the app's functionality rather than managing infrastructure.
- **Parse Server**: Back4App is based on Parse Server, an open-source backend framework, which offers databases, authentication, cloud functions, and file storage.
- **Scalable**: It automatically scales according to the app's needs, providing database and API management without manual configuration.
- **Real-time Data**: Back4App supports real-time data and push notifications, enabling interactive and responsive apps.
  
### Flutter & Back4App Integration
- **Parse SDK**: Flutter can integrate with Back4App through the Parse SDK, using it to store data, manage user authentication, and handle push notifications.
- **Easy Backend Setup**: Back4App’s simple integration allows Flutter developers to set up a backend quickly without much configuration.
- **Data Syncing**: It enables seamless data synchronization between the Flutter app and the Back4App database.
